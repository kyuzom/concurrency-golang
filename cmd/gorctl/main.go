/*
The way to successfully mitigate this is to establish a signal between the parent goroutine and its children that allows the parent to signal cancellation to its children.
By convention, this signal is usually a read-only channel named done.
The parent goroutine passes this channel to the child goroutine and then closes the channel when it wants to cancel the child goroutine.
